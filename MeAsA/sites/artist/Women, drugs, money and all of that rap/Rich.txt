(Rap over)
I BEEN BROKE SINCE 01
Y'ALL DON'T KNOW NONE
HUDDLIN OVA OPEN OVEN DOORS TO FEEL WARM
IN THE BITTER WINTER COLD

MOMMA HOLDIN US JUST TOLD US
IT'S GONE BE ALRIGHT
cuz she don't want her kids growin up frightened
THEN I HAVE TO COVER MY EARS
WHEN I HEAR HER CRYING IN THE NEXT ROOM ALL NIGHT and
THOSE ARE THE MEMORIES THAT CAUSE ME TO SAY


DON'T COME AROUND ME IF YOU AIN'T ON YO GRIND
MOMMA NEED HER RENT PAID ALL THE TIME
AND I GOT THE KNOWLEDGE TO PAY FOR LIL SISTER'S COLLEGE
SO THAT'S WHY I NEED TO GET
rich, rich, rich, rich

That's why I need to get rich, bitch
man oh man, I got a chance, shit
so If im spittin it better be vicious
delicious like whippin dishes in the kitchen,
man
you know I got the business, man
making millions like a businessman
addition real quick real fast
like a mathematician
ask anyone in my class
I've always been good at math




(sing max B chrous)

Fuck the rich rapper
buying gold chain, diamond rangs
Ballin
giving more money to hoes
than the community they grown up in when it's
fallin
they gone say why don't you pay the community then
and I'm gone say I AM THE COMMUNITY MAN
