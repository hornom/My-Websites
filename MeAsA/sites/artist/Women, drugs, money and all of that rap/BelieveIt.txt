(say it like a preacher)
believe it believe it
believe it believe it

my gift is one in a million
man I feel it
when I speak I can't help 
but believe it
I read my lyrics I can't help but believe
I feel like all y'all niggas give me hella reasons
to believe it.
send them demons off to hell
if they don't wanna help please believe
I could give a fuck, the way you gave 0 fucks
makes me do the same don't be a hypocrite
the stakes up i don't deal with no fakers
I got racks yo but don't waste it 
on the backs of ugly belly dancers

believe it believe it believe it believe it believe it

hatin ass demons saying I'm mistaken
sayin man you'll never make it
but I never believed them
I was never shakin
no pressure no fearing
im revved up and steaming
my engine like an audi
she said my body so godly
horsepower go like a logo in a rari

when im on the beat I can't help but feel free
I dont let the beat control me
you on the beat sounds a lot like you got
o c

on the beat im smooth and funky and groovy
you sound rough and stuck and floozy and tough
I feel like your crowd has had enough
lemme go and show you how to wanna make em go buck wild
plenty hoes bend ova about onuh eighty degrees butts piled

bitch you wanna face me?
you crazy? you should already know I'm amazing
hit you quick with my gift like bulletclips
or uppercuts on the beat of the percussion
because that's the repurcusion of interruptin me


I would never go easy on the beat
I will make you dance and boogie on your feet
like white kids at wisconsin party's
they just be bouncin around
Ill make you bounce up and down
how bout right now my smile take em down
I say "I'll make it worth yo while"
I give them what they came for, what they deserve
what they earned please believe it
please believe it believe me like migo s slippery
that flow is so easy peasy please believe me
take a chance and make em dancy like me, please
you couldn't do it, you just sit there and believe me
believe me.
