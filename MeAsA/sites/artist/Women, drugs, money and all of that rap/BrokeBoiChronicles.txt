you ever been ashamed of yo own life
I told  my story one lonely night
they told me don't talk about goin broke
these niggas is demons, they don't need to know

you wouldn't know what it's like to be poor
huddling with the fam over an open oven door
just to be warm in the bitter winter cold
heating won't function, the fridge isn't froze
how im gon make it, (I don't really know)/(I'm not really sure)

Not having dough have a way of making you feel alone
like waiting for the bus when ya buds have toyotas
or no coat when the winter comes and ya whole body froze
meanwhile ya white friends got piles of sweaters owen

neva brought niggas back to the crib,
did not want to show my lack of shit.
my happiness was not happenin since I was not havin cash
you coulda bought my happiness for a dollar snack


since I was 12 thru 16
I lived with momma's bad decision making
sit back n listen, relax n' hear me speak
this is broke boi chronicles, aka my story

think about your best friends
then imagine losing them
moving where the money is
new house, new crib,
new school, same shit.
that's what momma says so it's okay
she also says that I'll make new best friends
and I did
imagine making new friends
then imagine moving and losing them again
then make more new friends
then moving and losing them
again
then you make more new best friends
then you move and lose them
again
1, 2, 3, 4
wait I'm missing a fifth 
imagine getting used to a whole new place
where people wear different outfits
you get used to it
then you lose them
cuz you moving again n again n again n again

5 different states in 5 different years
I don't have no time for crying
I have no more tears
how do you not give up
that's what I ask everytime I wake up
to look forward to losing everything
again and again and again and again
