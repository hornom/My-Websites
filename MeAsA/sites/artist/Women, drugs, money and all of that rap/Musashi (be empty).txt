meditate your thoughts contemplate your actions
to be the best, you can't expect what comes next
you must simply be ready
simple be ready, simply be empty

don't hesitate and do not wait
simply be ready, for relaxing even for a moment
is the action that causes the death of many
life is not a path, it is a destination
keep your eyes focused, keep your eyes in concentration

your mind mustn't do much to simply not be corrupt
for the winning kind are characterized by a disciplined mind

but what is most important isn't your mind
but it is the lack of your heart
the art of the empty

I don't mean empty as in a container
I mean empty as in the lack of retainers
Empty as in the fact that you don't have a preference for behaviors
empty in the fact that you don't rely on a savior
empty in the fact that you don't fear dying
empty in the fact that you don't fear trying
but most of all
empty in the fact that you can't be enlightened
without sacrificing your titles, diamonds
and sense of self righteous

for being empty is the lack of everything
being empty is the lack of fond memories
being empty is not wanting to relax for the pleasure of feelings

so I say it again, listen well
