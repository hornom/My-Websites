word to big noyd
I was born with it
so even if I could
I won't give up the goods
cuz I was born with it
but that don't make me different
because everyone else did too
but the difference is that
they too scared to chase this path
I do me so I do what I'm supposed to
which is not to act
like im not about all of that rap
but that's hard to do
when everyone around you
so focused on what they was told to do
go to college, get some knowledge, work in an office, then you die
That's why I tell everyone I wanna study A.I
which I do, but not for science
but for my rap, 
cuz that's the level of creativity my mind is at

I already know that you dig the hole you die in
so what do I want
to be in the same accepted hole everyone else lies in
or be in one all on my own
And it's scary that the one
I'm supposed to be in
is the one that everyone's opposing
all I hear in my ear are a bunch of warnings
and reasons as to why I should be conforming
but I got a hard time listening
cuz im just too busy being me
(being me)

who am I?
all of that rap
I done moved so many times
that the only thing glued to me
is all of that rhyming,
timing, violent thing
y'know what I mean?
all of that rap
I don't know how to act
because of all of that rap
at least that's what momma says
behind all of my back
because it caused me to get high
and I agree, but it also got me by
my day to day grind
all of that rap

you would do what I did
if you was me
cuz everything that happens
is a reaction to a stimuli that happened
and that's out of my control
i know what's right
and I know what's wrong
but that won't ever change who I am
cuz I walk the only path I know
so You walk yours and I'll go walk my own

I remember ending up with no internet
for months on end with no end in sight
so I wrote sentences mentioning
how I want to end my life
y'know that generic teenage
emo shit
but it felt good to just let my pen go off
and get everything I could off my chest
Calling up my friends saying
"my guy we could get rich overnight"
y'know that generic teenage
naive shit

I used to rap and rhyme
for a loot bag and dimes
but sooner or later
I started to hunger for it
I would just end up in the shower for an hour or more
spitting lyrics, to my family I probably seemed
hysterical and delirious
speakin to myself, 
became the interdimensional translation speaker for the speaker beat
possessed with the holy ghost
like what J said In Ye's
never let me down
whenever I open my mouth
a touch of god reigns out

imagine me wildin out
jumping up and down
shoutin HOLY COW
what the fuck is going on right now
It was like an addict awoke in me
that good ol cliche line
cuz I just had to have it
(had to have what?)
(had to have what?)
(what what what what)

(beat goes silent)
you already know
All of that rap
