since I was 12 till i was 16
I had to live with my momma's decision making
this is what happened to me

think about your best friends
then imagine losing them because 
your moving to where the money is
that's what momma says so it's okay
she also says that I'll make new best friends
and I did
imagine making new friends
then imagine moving and losing them again
then make more new friends
then moving and losing them
again
then you make more new best friends
then you move and lose them
again
1, 2, 3, 4
wait I'm missing a fifth 
imagine getting used to a whole new place
where people wear different outfits
you get used to it
then you lose them
cuz you moving again n again n again n again

5 different states in 5 different years
I don't have no time for crying
I have no more tears
how do you not give up
that's what I ask everytime I wake up
to look forward to losing everything
again and again and again and again
