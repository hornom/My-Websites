im so mad for no reason
maybe it's the weed
mayb it's everybody
honestly its probably nothing at all
Im so mad fo no reason

All my boston crew
too scared to be brawlin
so I be thinkin if I'm fallin
will they come with open hands and wallets
will they come with lotta guns and rockets
will they come and pick me up with drugs and mollies


you're lucky im relaxing
and not asking at least one of them questions
cuz I already know the answer's negative
that could be a reason for me to be mad

fo no reason im so mad
that's what they tell me
but i must be mad
fo some reason
mayb it's the weed
mayb it's the price rise
mayb it's everybody
honestly its probably nothing at all


im so pissed im so mad
at my bitch at my dad
at my president
at the rich at the bad
at the hesitant
stuck being complacent
stuck in they places
waiting for somebody to come save them
maybe that somebody themselves needs saving
maybe you yourself is the one misbehavin
passing your blame on everybody
actin like you deserve something godly
when you and me both know you've only earned nawthing

Edit this VVVV
so go and get up off your ass
your responsibility is to change
your ill position in this game
ain't nobody gonna change
just because you tell them to
so who the fuck am I yelling to

I'ma just say this once
be humble enough to accept the truth
but stubborn enough to change it
that's something no one told me
nah nigga, I learned and gained and engrained and trained it
cuz if I'ma die
i won't be lookin at the sky
saying my oh my
i should've done more with my life
nah nigga the time is now
so im so mad

im so mad for no reason

my eggs like my ex
really devilled
