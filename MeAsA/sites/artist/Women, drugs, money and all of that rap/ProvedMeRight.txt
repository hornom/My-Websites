"You can't fall for a girl crying my guy
most masterpiece women are master emotional manipulators man
I swear she will bawl her eyes out and say she loves you
right after she screws you ova
so listen to me at the end of the day
no matter how hard she cries
don't forget the fact that she proved you right
in the words of big noyd, fuck that bitch
tell her to get off your dick
even if she's crying and she says she has feelins n shit
cuz you shouldn't forget that"


you proved me right
actions speak louder than words
that's why your excuses and lies aren't heard
you proved me right
you proved me right
I can't date no dame
who don't know left from right
I can stay up all night
trying to find reasons as to why you're mine
but I just got a text sayin 
you proved me right
you proved me right

I don't get what i deserve
every nigga agrees and says word
I dont hesitate when I say it's for the best
for us to break up and stop doing dates
because when it comes to being mine
you're unreliable

so go and cry some more
so go and lie some more
go and do all that shit you've been dying for
cuz you know I won't give it to you anymore
I won't call you a whore
matter of fact, I won't call you at all anymore
I'll just show you the door and say
goodbye beautiful

I may still stop by your house
and we can still make out
and smoke all the loud
but don't get it twisted
because we ain't together, we're over, no more, fo sho
cuz I can't trust you, and what's a relationship without that
that's right, just lust, no love, just lust

so while you lie and say I never tried
say I never did you right
I'll be in the bakck of yo mind
laughing my ass off saying
look, again, you proved me right

you proved me right
I did you right, stayed by yo side
late long phone calls through the night
but at the end of that night
you proved me right

we got the stanky danky
she thanking me for the hanky panky
no problem baby
you just can't date me
cuz you love the drama more than the relationship
I got don't time for all of that commotion


YOU PROVED ME RIGHT (BITCH)
YOU PROVED ME RIGHT (BITCH)
I CAN'T BE WITH ANYBODY WHO DON'T LEFT FROM RIGHT (BITCH)
I HAD TO LEAVE AT THE END, CUZ YOU PROVED ME RIGHT (BITCH)
YOUR PROVED ME RIGHT (BITCH)
I DRIVE MY LIFE LIKE I HAVE A LICENSE
SO I LET YOU PASS ME BY ON THE RIGHT LANE
IF YOU GOIN TOO FAST, JUST LIKE WHEN IM DRIVIN
YOU PROVED ME RIGHT (BITCH)
