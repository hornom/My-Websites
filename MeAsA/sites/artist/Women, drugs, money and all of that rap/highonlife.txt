I'm in boston workin in an office
makin money to get my own apartment
so I don't worry about sneakin my broad
in the darkness without wakin up moms
shit makin progress like this
makes me feel a lil bit enlightened

I lay on my bed at night
watching my ceiling fan turn clockwise
thinking I remember when my life was just smoking weed
if I died in those days, people would know me
as the guy who was always in a haze from smokin on that haze
no one gives heys to a guy who misbehaves
if I died in those days, it would say on my grave
this guy was high everyday and that's it

I mean I'm too smart for this, I skipped fifth grade
I can get to college by sixteen and get my mom's rent paid
I thought about how much effort and work she invested in me
just to throw it all away to friends who want me to waste
my time, money, and life on some weed

I made the resolution to get out of my confusion
I moved my view based on profuse amounts of loot

Now I've been stuck in an office for 10 years
God I wish I did what made me happy and kept on rapping
now I'm acting like I'm happy, where did I lose my way

guess I got too high on life
