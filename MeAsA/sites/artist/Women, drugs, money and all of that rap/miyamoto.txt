she was flexible she was smart she was nice
they was this and they was thAT
BUT i don't pay em no mind cuz they proved me right
and that's unforgivable
call it being stubborn call it pride
i don't care, I was raised by miyamoto
musashi said you're a warrior you're a soldier
so don't put down your pride
cuz you can defend it against 
however many of them
if you can defeat one man, you can defeat ten thousand of them
so there's no difference between one and a million
my principles make me one in a million
I don't have time for one or a million
unless it's one or a million dollars
the mindstate of a big baller
the mindstate of total focus
the mindstate of miyamoto

You wanna verse me?
I got verses built for a versus
for example
my rappin just happens like automatic
I'll use my gift like a full clip from a gat
attackin at where ya backpack is at
cuz like I said when im rappin
it just happens like an automatic mac
rat tat tat
you'll hit the ground without a sound
of anything 
(beat goes silent)
but my mouth

wow ow yowch
how about now
still wanna go for a round or two
with a dude that isn't confused
on the route to choose
on the way of rap
like musashi miyamoto
and bruce lee
my tao is just something 
you 
can't 
hope 
to 
beat
ayyyy
