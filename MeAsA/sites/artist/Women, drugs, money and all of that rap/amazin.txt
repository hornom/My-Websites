Make the whole song just like Just what I am

I translate the beat swear
I hear it speaking in my ear
telling me to come and make everybody disappear
ain

ay ea zay bacon pig niggas can't phase me 
with they beef i'm too busy bein myself 
amazin
Its for certain never maybe when my verses and lyrics
are written in ways that make you say 
I'm ay may zayn
yay say it with me baby im ay may zayn
hey say it with me baby im ay may zayn
they say it with me baby im ay may zayn

let you know I'm not mistaken or hesitatin
or sweatin or bettin or contemplatin or even meditatin bout it
hell I'll even shout it 
bitch I'm amazin
bitch ay may zayn (this is the sample I'm referring to))


It's not a maybe when I say I'm amazin
Proof is in the puddin when i put it in you puddin
and she puttin on a cummin face
put her on a plane to the bay basically played her
and the way she said im amazin
make you feel an amazin type of anger

so how do I pick my topics of conversation?
The best way for me to explain is that
if a picture says a thousand words, then an instrumental says 10 million more
so I say 10 million words, and 10 million verses
over and over

I'm so myself like new york niggas big L Rakim Pharcyde and Nas 
saying word is bond on my moms cross my heart i go so damn hard
That my audience's necks hurt like reck
from all that boppin and rockin
god damn it's like when I'm on the mic jock
they get a different type of high like they touchin the sky
when they realize I'm able to be alive with this guy

any place to any one on any day in any way
I'm ay may zing
ain't no fakin if you wanna make it
do you got what it takes
no hesitating and contemplating on the beat
put the bass in ya face
if I catch you hating, lacking or complaining

Pop a popper on me to pop ops, imposters, and paparazzi off me
pop up at an improper party and get it properly poppin
ain't no probably ya head be boppin non stoppin
cuz you know it ain't no problem 
im uh big papi
im uh big papi

my missions is to get many millions
so if im spittin it'll be vivious
lyrics written in efficient ways so even if its quick spittin
it didn't sound like gibberish if you're listenin, bitch

if they don't say I am amazin
It don't phase me cuz my name ain't
katy perry, put no validity in what they saying
I don't say it just cuz I do things amazing
I say it just cuz I feel amazing
